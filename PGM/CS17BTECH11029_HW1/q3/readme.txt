Q3. Baum-Welch Algorithm for HMM
===================================

**Train HMM**
- python3 train.py
- Change the checkpoint path and model directory.

**Classiffier**
- Load the corresponding models and classify
- python3 classify.py

=====================================
**Observations**
- Algorithm needed more than 50 hidden nodes. Using lesser features results in unstable training.
- As we increase node the likelihood of data increases relatively.
- The precision of classifier also increase with increase in nodes.
